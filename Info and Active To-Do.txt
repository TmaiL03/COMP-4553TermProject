Current Development Pipeline (Updated 26/02/25 @ 9:27pm):
IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
- Limit character movements to the confines of the map.
    - Limit number of tiles over which character can move to a predetermined number (an amount corresponding to the number of development points allocated to movement for that turn).
- Revise textures (currently these are just placeholders).
- Implement sorting layer and texture mapping for settlements.
- Integrate menus and UI components with basic movement mechanics (Kayla/Liam J we can discuss about how to merge these as needed).
    - Following integrating these, specifying the number of players, and then instantiating a corresponding number of instances of the Player prefab (one for each player).
- Add some additional editor data to the Player GameObject for development points and other related data fields.

    - #1, #2, and (to a more limited extent) #4 were particularly useful (have yet to finish the others).
