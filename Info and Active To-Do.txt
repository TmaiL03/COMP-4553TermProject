Current Development Pipeline (Updated 03/03/25 @ 10:22am):
IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
- Implementing turn-based functionality.
- Limit number of tiles over which character can move to a predetermined number (an amount corresponding to the number of development points allocated to movement for that turn).
- Reconfigure movement system such that Colliders and RigidBodies are used in place of arbitrary coordinate bounds.
- Revise textures (currently these are just placeholders).
- Implement sorting layer and texture mapping for settlements.
- Integrate menus and UI components with basic movement mechanics (Kayla/Liam J we can discuss about how to merge these as needed).

Resources Used So Far (Updated: 03/03/25 @ 10:22am):
- Tutorial Series for TileMaps, textures, and initialization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzbbE0ySD54&list=PLvdaHZw6zzmt94YFtnfzTLtgkyZlNh9go
    - #1, #2, and (to a more limited extent) #4 were particularly useful (have yet to finish the others).
- Tile-based movement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbzXIOKZurA
- Turn-based mechanics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5pm29yhaTs
    - I (Liam T) haven't watched this video yet, but given it's tile map style, it may be a helpful resource for turn-based mechanisms.
